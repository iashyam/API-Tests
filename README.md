# API-Tests

- At first I have tried to get respose from Google API. I have tried to extract information about my YouTube channel.
- Then I have moved to extract blogger information using blogger API. I have successfully extracted the blog information along with data of the posts.
- I have also tried to get some data using facebook API.
- My ultimate goal is to get data about my instagram account. I want to post on instagram using API. That will help me to operate my instagram account without actually installing instagram.
- Another idea is to use AI to create videos and then post them to instagram reels. I would use AI to find hashtags as well. Then also get the most tranding audio to that video. That way I would be able to grow my instagram without even opening it on my phone. Using it on my phone is such a waste of time.
